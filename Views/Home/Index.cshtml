                    There are two main parts to the BYU Egypt Excavation Project. The part
                    with which this database is concerned is the Fag El-Gamous cemetery. This cemetery was in
                    use during the Graeco-Roman era of Egyptian history. In the early 1900’s some Mummy Portraits
                    were found there by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt. The cemetery is very large and densely populated with burials.

                    Fag El-Gamous is an ancient Egyptian cemetery located in the Faiyum
                    Governorate dating from the 1st to the 7th century AD, the period of Roman
                    rule in Egypt. The cemetery was discovered by a team of archeologists from
                    Brigham Young University in 1980. They were given sole responsibility for the excavation in 1981.

                    This database is designed to make the work of the BYU Egypt
                    Excavation Project available to the world. It represents the data gained from decades
                    of excavation combined with digital analytical power that should make any number of
                    studies possible. We believe that the data presented herein makes it possible for
                    us to tell something of the stories of those who lived so long ago in Egypt, and
                    that those stories deserve to be told.

                <p>
                    During multiple years of study, researchers have excavated more than 1,000 mummies
                    and collected data in field notes, spreadsheets, and simple databases about each mummy’s
                    location, physical orientation in the ground, burial depth, hair color, wrapping (including
                    information about the textiles used), sex, age, bone (including skull and teeth) dimensions,
                    items accompanying the mummy, and more. And, of course, there are many, many photographs. Offsite,
                    researchers have performed a variety of analyses on the excavated items including carbon dating, DNA sequencing, and others.
